# EM-Oracle-Fun
Small project to have fun building code to make predictions of the outcome  for matches of the soccer EM 2021. Goal of the project is to provide a home of implementations that solve the problem of predicting the outcome of a soccer match. It may be used for fun purposes in future.
## Rules
1) If your favourite language/technology/framework is not allready present in the project add a folder with the name of your favorite language/technology/framework and create an extendable launcher application containing your tak or takes.
2) If your favourite language/technology/framework allready exists simply add your version in a clean way to the existing launcher.
3) Every single solution shall take the two teamnames as parameter and return a text containing the goals of each team and proclaim the winner.
## Additional info
A first example is implemented in react and therefore resides in the react subfolder. Feel free to share and spread the word.

Have Fun!
